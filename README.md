# RAFFLE BACKEND DAPP âœ…

This is a full stack decentralized Raffle App using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Keepers, Solidity and Next.js from workshop from Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2022 and which is also complemented by Patrick Alpha's Free Code Camp course.

This repo contains all the stuff for the back-end part, the front-end is hold on [raffle-frontend](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-frontend).

To achieve fully descentralization the Front-End has been uploaded to IPFS: ipfs://QmQcHesAvg1bvvML582v3ZFbF5fnTiakwRDFs1LhG1o4BF.

The workshop followed to complete this repo is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bMrko6iD9Q&t=5445s).

The used repos from Patricks are the followings:

1. [Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc): Patrick's repo that we are building.
2. [Front-end Smart Contract Lottery](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/nextjs-smartcontract-lottery-fcc): Patrick's repo for the Front-end part.
3. [Patricks Hardhat course video](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc).

## OBJETIVES

<< Writing the contracts >>

1. Decentralized RANDOM Raffle.
2. User enter (for a fee).
3. Pick a RANDOM winner.
    1. Autonomous: We never have to interact.
    2. Provable random.

<< Build the Front End >>

1. Buttons using NextJS
2. Deploy it in a decentralized context

## CREATE SIMILAR PROJECT FROM SCRATCH

-   Start hardhat project:

```bash
yarn add --dev hardhat
yarn hardhat
```

-   Add .gitignore file containing:

```bash
node_modules
.env
coverage
coverage.json
typechain
deployments

#Hardhat files
cache
artifacts
```

Notice: you can include more ignore cases in your `.gitignore` by copying the content from [.gitignore](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack/blob/main/.gitignore).

-   Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle hardhat hardhat-contract-sizer hardhat-deploy hardhat-gas-reporter prettier prettier-plugin-solidity solhint solidity-coverage dotenv @chainlink/contracts
```

or

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
npm install @chainlink/contracts
npm install dotenv --save
```

## HOW TO COMPILE

```bash
yarn hardhat compile
```

or

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## HOW TOT DEPLOY

-   DISCLAIMER: Always deploy first LOCALLY

-   Deploy on Rinkeby:

```bash
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```

or

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```

## HOW TOT DEPLOY

If you want to use [Hardhat shorthand](https://hardhat.org/guides/shorthand):

```bash
yarn global add hardhat-shorthand
```

You can now run Hardhat commands by:

```bash
hh compile
hh deploy
```

## Add Chainlink VRF Consumers and Keepers

In order that our Contract works correctly with Chainlink VRF we need to add our Smart Contract Address as VRF consumer. To do so:

1. Go to [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link).
2. Create a 'Subscription' or use an existing one
3. Add 'consumer': Smart Contract Address
   NOTICE: check that Subscription has enough funds (LINK)

To register into Chainlink Keepers (To execute lottery automatically):

1. Go to [Chainlink Keepers](https://keepers.chain.link/).
2. Click on 'register new keeper'.
3. Fill up the data (set gasLimit > 500000).

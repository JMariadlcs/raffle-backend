# RAFFLE BACKEND DAPP âœ…

This is a full stack decentralized Raffle App using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Keepers, Solidity and Next.js from workshop from Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2022 and which is also complemented by Patrick Alpha's Free Code Camp course.

This repo contains all the stuff for the back-end part, the front-end is hold on [raffle-frontend](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-frontend).

To achieve fully descentralization the Front-End has been uploaded to IPFS and fleek: ipfs://QmexxqxhViwpFsbWnbMktNhG3qsukTA58rLyLQaCpg8vy3, https://curly-butterfly-3592.on.fleek.co/

The workshop followed to complete this repo is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bMrko6iD9Q&t=5445s).

The used repos from Patricks are the followings:

1. [Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc): Patrick's repo that we are building.
2. [Front-end Smart Contract Lottery](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/nextjs-smartcontract-lottery-fcc): Patrick's repo for the Front-end part.
3. [Patricks Hardhat course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=15996s).

## OBJETIVES

<< Writing the contracts >>

1. Decentralized RANDOM Raffle.
2. User enter (for a fee).
3. Pick a RANDOM winner.
    1. Autonomous: We never have to interact.
    2. Provable random.

<< Build the Front End >>

1. Buttons using NextJS
2. Deploy it in a decentralized context

## CREATE SIMILAR PROJECT FROM SCRATCH

-   Start hardhat project:

```bash
yarn add --dev hardhat
yarn hardhat
```

-   Add .gitignore file containing:

```bash
node_modules
.env
coverage
coverage.json
typechain
deployments

#Hardhat files
cache
artifacts
```

Notice: you can include more ignore cases in your `.gitignore` by copying the content from [.gitignore](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack/blob/main/.gitignore).

-   Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle hardhat hardhat-contract-sizer hardhat-deploy hardhat-gas-reporter prettier prettier-plugin-solidity solhint solidity-coverage dotenv @chainlink/contracts
```

or

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
npm install @chainlink/contracts
npm install dotenv --save
```

## HOW TO COMPILE

```bash
yarn hardhat compile
```

or

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## HOW TOT DEPLOY

If you want to use [Hardhat shorthand](https://hardhat.org/guides/shorthand):

```bash
yarn global add hardhat-shorthand
```

You can now run Hardhat commands by:

```bash
hh compile
hh deploy
```

## HOW TO TEST

Two types of tests are created for this project:

1. "Unit tests" inside [unit](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack/tree/main/test/unit): used to test functions separately
2. "Integration tests" inside [staging](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack/tree/main/test/staging): used to test entire contracts

To execute tests **unit tests** (on development chain):

```bash
yarn hardhat test
```

and to see test coverage:

```bash
yarn hardhat coverage
```

To execute tests **integrated tests** (on testnet):

**REMINDER**: contract should be deployed with correct chainId on Chainlink VRF and must be added to Chainlink Keepers

```bash
yarn hardhat test --network rinkeby
```

and to see test coverage:

```bash
yarn hardhat coverage
```

## Add Chainlink VRF Consumers and Keepers

In order that our Contract works correctly with Chainlink VRF we need to add our Smart Contract Address as VRF consumer. To do so:

1. Go to [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link).
2. Create a 'Subscription' or use an existing one
3. Add 'consumer': Smart Contract Address
   NOTICE: check that Subscription has enough funds (LINK)

To register into Chainlink Keepers (To execute lottery automatically):

1. Go to [Chainlink Keepers](https://keepers.chain.link/).
2. Click on 'register new keeper'.
3. Fill up the data (set gasLimit > 500000).

**NOTICE** make sure to deploy contracts with its corresponding subID depending on the chain we are deploying, check [helper-hardhat-config.js](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/raffle-full-stack/blob/main/helper-hardhat-config.js)
